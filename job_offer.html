	<a>University of Bergen, Norway</a><br>
	<h2>Research fellow (PhD candidate) in computational catalysis and molecular design</h2>

	The University of Bergen (UiB) is an internationally recognised research university with more than 14,000 students and close to 3,500 employees at six faculties. The university is located in the heart of Bergen. Our main contribution to society is excellent basic research and education across a wide range of disciplines.

	<h3>Research fellow (PhD candidate) in computational catalysis and molecular design</h3>

	The Department of Chemistry, University of Bergen, has a vacancy for a research fellow (PhD candidate) in computational catalysis and molecular design for four years (including teaching duties, see below for details) connected to an interdisciplinary project, funded by the Research Council of Norway, on the development of homogeneous catalysts for the conversion of lignin-derived bio-oil to biofuel.
	<h3>About the project/work tasks</h3>

	We will develop recyclable catalysts for environmentally friendly and economically viable removal of the remaining oxygen functionalities of lignin-derived bio-oil to give biofuel. The catalysts will be developed with the help of mechanistic insight and predictions from molecular-level calculations, and these calculations will be the focus of the PhD student.
	<br>
	Other project co-workers will synthesize and test the most promising predicted catalysts, and the project will involve close collaboration between the computational and experimental chemists.
	<h3>Qualifications and personal qualities</h3>

    The applicant must have achieved a master’s degree or equivalent in chemistry, physics or bordering fields, or have submitted their master’s thesis for assessment prior to the application deadline. It is a condition of employment that the master’s degree has been awarded.
    Candidates should have a strong background in quantum chemistry and applied quantum chemistry. Background from other branches of computational chemistry, such as molecular mechanics and dynamics, is also relevant.
    Knowledge of inorganic/organometallic chemistry is an advantage.
    Knowledge of methods of cheminformatics and chemometrics is an advantage.
    Experience in programming is an advantage.
    The successful candidate must have well-developed critical thinking and writing skills.
    The ability to work independently, in a structured manner, and also be able to cooperate with others.
    Proficiency in both written and oral English is necessary.
    The teaching language will normally be Norwegian. The successful applicant is expected to be able to teach in Norwegian or one of the other Scandinavian languages early in the fellowship period. Foreign candidates will be given the opportunity to enroll in Norwegian language courses.

	<h3>About the PhD position</h3>

	The duration of the PhD position is 4 years, of which 25 per cent of the time each year comprises obligatory duties associated with research, teaching and dissemination of results. The employment period may be reduced if you have previously been employed in a recruitment position.
	About the research training

	The application and appendices with certified translations into English or a Scandinavian language must be uploaded at Jobbnorge.
